## Introduction

After a couple of years using MongoDB's official driver, there have been many pain points in the near-complete lack of documentation, and behavior that can be somewhat counter-intuitive.  The base driver allows you to do a lot - but it has a steep learning curve and is very verbose.  MINQ isn't a replacement for the driver; instead, it's a wrapper built as an additional layer to make it more accessible.

MINQ aims to improve:

* Readability
* Documentation
* Expanded functionality
* Maintaining indexes
* Transaction management

This project is still young; at the peak of its use at R Studios, we only had ~180k unique user accounts.  This has not been tested at a significantly large scale.

|:------------------|:---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Auto-Index        | An Index that was automatically created based on MINQ usage.  MINQ attempts to intelligently detect and resolve non-performant queries, but may fail occasionally to do so.  Auto-Indexes are named "minq_X".  **An Auto-Index can never have a unique constraint.**                                                                                                                                                 |
| Consumed          | MINQ requests can be used exactly once.  Once you've issued a Terminal Command, the request is then **Consumed**, and trying to issue further Terminal Commands on it will throw an exception.                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| Covered Query     | Indicates that the current request can be completed entirely using Indexes.  Virtually all queries should be Covered to be considered performant.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| Filter Chain      | A lambda expression resulting in a Method Chain to build out a Mongo filter.  A FilterChain must always be the first chain defined in a RequestChain.  Once a FilterChain is defined, you can lead into UpdateChain or Terminal Methods to complete your query.                                                                                                                                                      |
| Index             | A constantly-maintained lookup table used by Mongo to optimize queries.  Indexes are incredibly important to keep performant queries.  Manual indexes can be specified with `mongo.DefineIndexes()` in any MinqService.                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| Index Chain       | A lambda expression resulting in a Method Chain to build out an index.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| Method Chain      | A practice more common in JavaScript than C#, this is when an object performs updates or other actions but keeps returning itself.  This results in stylistically-different code, but is particularly useful because you get code completion prompts / comments that can help guide you through a full update on the object you're using.  MINQ is heavily reliant on chains and should be used as much as possible. |
| MINQ              | Pronounced "mink", like the weasel-cousin.  It stands for **M**ongo **IN**tegrated **Q**uery.  A MINQ is the shorthand term for any single MinqSingleton built with this utility, but also refers to the library itself.                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| Request Chain     | A lambda expression resulting in a Method Chain to build out a complete Mongo request.  This acts as an entry point to FilterChains and UpdateChains.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| Terminal Method   | Any method that completes the request.  This can be an update command or one that returns data, such as `ToList()` or `Project()`.  Once the request is completed, it is **Consumed** and cannot be used again.                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| Unique Constraint | An optional component of an Index.  When an Index is Unique, it means that the combination of fields that make up the index can never result in a duplicate partial object.  See the Using Indexes section for more.                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| Update Chain      | A lambda expression resulting in a Method Chain to build out an update statement.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |

## Creating a Singleton (a "mink")

Every collection document model should have at least one corresponding singleton for access.  This keeps maintenance straightforward.  If you're using the same model in multiple collections, use multiple Minqs.

First, you'll need your model:

```csharp
public class Foo : MinqDocument
{
    public string Bar { get; set; }
    public int Count { get; set; }
    public long CreatedOn { get; set; }
    public string[] Names { get; set; }
}
```

Then you'll need your singleton:

```csharp
public class FooMinq : Minq<Foo>
{
    public FooMinq() : base("foos") { }
}
```

### Queries & Updates

MINQ is designed to borrow heavily from LINQ syntax so it feels familiar.  Method names are borrowed - where applicable - and every request is built on a single method chain.  Every request ends in a Terminal Method; one that consumes the request and cannot be reused or chained further.  Specifying fields relies on field expressions, something the Mongo driver used.

Let's try some simple queries our Foo objects:

```csharp
mongo
    .Where(query => query.EqualTo(foo => foo.Count, 15))
    .Limit(10)
    .ToList();

mongo
    .Where(query => query
        .EqualTo(foo => foo.Bar, "Hello, World!")
        .GreaterThan(foo => foo.Count, 15)
    )
    .Or(query => query.Contains(foo => foo.Names, "Will"))
    .Limit(10)
    .ToList();

mongo
    .Where(query => query.LessThanOrEqualTo(foo => foo.CreatedOn, Timestamp.Now))
    .Update(query => query.Set(foo => foo.Count, 42));

mongo
    .Where(query => query.EqualTo(foo => foo.Id, "deadbeefdeadbeefdeadbeef")
    .Delete();
```

Ideally, these method chains read easily enough that no further explanation is needed.  Unlike Mongo's driver - which has a half dozen overloads for every method - the code completion popups should also be helpful here, allowing developers to explore the tools within their IDE of choice.

### Using Transactions

MINQ attempts to make transactions as easy to manage as possible.

#### What is a Transaction and when should I use one?

Transactions are valuable tools you can employ when you want to perform multiple actions against a dataset that must take effect together.  In other words, you're using a set of commands that should only modify the data when **all of them** are successful, and if any operation fails, no changes are committed.

Imagine you're writing an endpoint that transfers money from a user's checking account to their savings account.  There are two operations that are absolutely critical: first, you have to deduct the amount from the checking, then add the same amount to the savings.  If your code fails for any reason between these steps, you don't want an account to lose money, or another to gain money, without the other operation.

If you wrap these two operations in a single transaction, we can guarantee that they'll only take effect if they're both successful.

There are a couple of noteworthy rules when working with Transactions:
1. All operations in a Transaction must be completed within 30 seconds of starting one.  This is a limit imposed by MongoDB.  _If you need to debug your code, be aware your transactions may time out while you're paused on a breakpoint._
2. The database won't reflect **any** changes until the Transaction is committed.

#### Example Usage in MINQ

Let's take those previous two query examples from above, but add Transaction support to them:

```csharp
mongo
    .WithTransaction(out Transaction transaction)
    .Where(query => query.LessThanOrEqualTo(foo => foo.CreatedOn, Timestamp.UnixTime))
    .Update(query => query.Set(foo => foo.Count, 42));

mongo
    .WithTransaction(transaction)
    .Where(query => query.EqualTo(foo => foo.Id, "deadbeefdeadbeefdeadbeef")
    .Delete();
    
transaction.Commit();
```

If for any reason that first update fails, the following delete call won't affect anything.  MINQ is also smart enough to ignore method chains if the transaction has previously been consumed.  At the time of writing, if you want to use a transaction, you need to manually close it out with either `Abort()` or `Commit()`.  MINQ will get a future update that warns on any detected transactions that weren't finalized, but it will always be safest to close them out yourself.

### Using Indexes

Indexes are crucial in keeping a database performant.  If you've ever used a cookbook before, you know how important the index at the back can be.  If you're looking for a recipe that uses leeks, you can use the index at the back to look up "leek", alphabetically, and get a list of page numbers where the ingredient is used.  Databases are no different.

To create indexes with MINQ, you need to use the method `mongo.DefineIndexes()`; but before we get there, lets go over a few things first.

#### The Golden Rule

Whenever you create a filter, you _almost always_ should have an index to cover it.  The fields you use in your filter should correspond to a separate index.  Let's say you have the following query:

```csharp
mongo
    .Where(query => query
        .EqualTo(model => model.Foo, 5)
        .EqualTo(model => model.Bar, 10)
        .LessThan(model => model.Fubar, 100)
    )...
```

In this case, you should have an index created for `model.Foo`, `model.Bar`, and `model.Fubar`.*  Any time any of these fields are updated on Mongo - either from updates, insertions, or deletions - the index will be updated and the database will have an easier time finding the records.

Notes:

1. The order that indexes are defined in is important, but this is better explained by reading Mongo's documentation for it instead.  For a tl;dr, know that you should have fields testing Equality listed before those that are tested for Ranges (e.g. `LessThan()`).
2. \* Assume you have an index with five fields defined, on A, B, C, D, and E.  If a request comes in with a filter on A, B, and C, that request is covered by the index.  However, if the request comes in with A, D, B, it won't be covered, and will need a separate index.  Refer to Mongo's documentation for more information.
3. Try to keep your queries limited in the fields they're searching on.  The more varied your filters are, the more indexes Mongo has to maintain, which can become very taxing on performance and storage requirements if abused.

#### Automatic Indexes

MINQ will always attempt to create indexes based on usage.  When MINQ detects that a query is not covered, it will guess what the appropriate index is, then create it on the database as a background task.  An Auto-Index will always be created with the name `minq_X`, where X is the largest numbered Auto-Index currently existing on the database plus one.

While this can be relied upon for most general use, you should be aware of a few potential issues:

1. Mongo has some restrictions on what indexes can cover.  For example, an index can only cover one array (or other collection type) in a model.  So, if you write a MINQ query that filters on two separate arrays (updates are OK), you will inevitably see errors that index creation is failing.  Auto-Index creation failures won't crash your service, but they can be indicators that you've built an anti-pattern into your model structure.
2. Auto-Indexes never use Unique Constraints
3. Auto-Indexes never use a descending order on a field

You can obtain slightly better performance with manually-specified indexes.  However, Auto-Indexes are still important in guaranteeing that we don't have a compute- or memory-bound database if there's an oversight - we don't want a collection missing a few indexes to bring down the entire database, or force it to scale up artificially.

#### Manual Indexes

You can obtain precise control over your indexes using MINQ's `DefineIndex()` or `DefineIndexes()` methods.  As a code style guideline, this should be called from within your `MinqService` constructor:

```csharp
public MyMinqService() : base("foos")
{
    mongo.DefineIndexes(
        index => index.Add(model => model.Foo),
        index => index.Add(model => model.Bar, ascending: false),
        index => index
            .Add(model => model.Fubar)
            .EnforceUniqueConstraint()
            .SetName("uniq")
    )
}
```

This bit of code has a lot going on.  Firstly, `DefineIndexes` accepts a `params` of lambda expressions.  Each of these expressions will build an index that is then created on the database.

A descending sort is less often used, but can be useful if the query you're going to use is looking for recent records first, as an example, and the field is a timestamp.

The third index has a Unique Constraint added to it.  These index chains are the only way to specify a unique index with MINQ.  It also manually specifies the index name - which is purely a cosmetic choice, but can help differentiate your manual indexes from Auto-Indexes.

When this method completes, MINQ will create all three of these indexes if they don't already exist.

#### Unique Indexes

You can enforce unique values on your collection with a Unique Constraint, as illustrated above.  When this constraint is specified, it guarantees that the collection you're working with never sees a duplicate record based on the fields the index contains.

Let's say you have a mailbox for every user, and your Mailbox model has an `AccountId` field.  Creating a Unique Constraint on this will provide you with a promise that you never have a situation where the same user has more than one Mailbox.

It's worth noting that this can apply to multiple fields, too.  If your index has a unique constraint on both `AccountId` and `OperatingSystem`, you could effectively separate your Mailboxes based on the system the user is on.

**IMPORTANT:** Unique constraints will cause index creation to fail if there's already a violation in the data.  You will have to prune the offending data before you can create the index.  Keep an eye out for failed events in logs!

#### Deleting Indexes

Currently not supported.

### Paging

Paged queries is a very useful tool when building a UI that needs to connect to a large data set.  As an example, when you're searching Amazon for cat toys, you don't want a server to be returning 20 million different toys at once.  Instead, you only want 25/50/100 results per page.  Use
paging to accomplish this.  Let's say you're looking through the fourth page of cat toys with 100 results per page:

```csharp
mongo
    .All()
    .Page(size: 100, number: 4, out long remaining);
```

The `out long` there tells you how many more records there are, which can be used to deduce how many more pages there are left to view.  There is an overload to `Page()` that also provides an `out long total`, should you need it.

#### Processing

Should you ever need to process data in batches, MINQ provides a way for you to do this as an extension of its paging functionality.  Note that this kind of data manipulation is not intended for frequent use, but mostly exists for flexibility down the line to support future needs, but at a high level this:

1. Uses a paged query to create batches
2. Loads each batch into memory one at a time
3. Performs a defined action / lambda expression to access / transform these batches

Theoretical example: we need a scheduled task that runs once per week, takes all players created since the last run, cross-references another service for some additional data, and does something with it.

```csharp
long now = Timestamp.UnixTime;
long lastRunTime = GetLastRunTime();
SetLastRunTime(now);

mongo
    .Where(query => query
        .GreaterThan(player => player.CreatedOn, lastRunTime)
        .LessThanOrEqualTo(player => player.CreatedOn, now)   // Possibly redundant; edge cases might see a record created after our "now" timestamp
    )
    .Process(batchSize: 10, onBatch: data =>
    {
        Player[] batch = data.Results;
        Log.Info("MINQ processing {data.PercentComplete}% complete.");
        foreach (Player player in batch)
        {
            // Do something with each player here
            if (...)          // critical error condition
            {
                data.Stop();
                Log.Error($"MINQ processing failed after {data.Processed} records.");
            }
        }
        
        if (data.Remaining == 0)
            Log.Info("MINQ processing complete.");
    });
```

Note that while Transactions are still supported for processing, this is necessarily going to be a slow operation.  Transactions will fail if they take more than 30 seconds, so if you're going to use one, make sure your initial query doesn't return an extremely large data set.  This kind of processing can be useful for scheduled tasks, analysis, or upgrade scripts, and is generally discouraged from use in regular services and designed more for one-off scripts or on-demand programs.

Before using processing, consider if there are more efficient ways to achieve what you want - using projection, or flat updates, et cetera.  However, the flexibility is there should you need it.

**Important:** It's heavily discouraged to modify the collection you're querying against during processing, as this will affect the paging results.  Modifying other collections is fine.

## Searching with MINQ

You can now perform searches on your collection with MINQ as a built-in feature.  Before you can use it, though, there's a little bit of setup.  First, you need to update your model to implement the `ISearchable<T>` interface:

```csharp
public class MyModel : MinqDocument, ISearchable<MyModel>
{
    public string SomeString { get; set; }
    public string OtherString { get; set; }
    public string ImportantString { get; set; }
    ...
    
    // The following are required by the ISearchable interface.
    public long SearchWeight { get; set; }                            // The score the search assigned when weighing search terms.
    public double SearchConfidence { get; set; }                      // A percentage indicating how relevant the result is compared to other returned models.
    
    // After Mongo returns records, these weights are used to calculate a model's relevance.  For accurate results, 
    // these should match all the fields you use in the Search() call.  These weights allow you to prefer certain fields
    // as you see fit.  Being a method, you have the flexibility to alter the weights at runtime if you don't use magic
    // or constant values, e.g. via Dynamic Config.
    public Dictionary<Expression<Func<Guild, object>>, int> DefineSearchWeights() => new()
    {
        { model => model.ImportantString, 100 },
        { model => model.SomeString, 10 },
        { model => model.OtherString, 1 }
    };
}
```

**Important Note:** Weights are only used _after_ Mongo returns results.  If your search matches 100k records, the weights will only apply to the few records returned, and won't return the most relevant results from the entire database.  If you find yourself in this situation, leverage the other features of a MINQ request to refine your search.

Once your model is updated, you can use `Search()` in your MinqService:

```csharp
public class MyModelMinq : Minq<MyModel>
{
    ...
    public MyModel[] Search(params string[] terms) => mongo
        .Where(query => query.GreaterThan(model => model.CreatedOn, Timestamp.OneWeekAgo))
        .Limit(25)
        .Cache(Interval.TwoHours)
        .Sort(sort => sort.OrderByDescending(model => model.CreatedOn)
        .Search(terms);
}
```

In order of execution, this is telling minq:

1. Only return documents that are less than one week old AND contain one of the specified search terms.
2. If the results contain too many documents, return the most recently created documents first.
3. Limit the results to a maximum of 25 documents.
4. Once the query comes back, store this query as a cached search for two hours.  If this exact query is run during this time, the same exact data will be returned.
5. Calculate the relevance of all the returned documents and return them in descending order of confidence.

### How Relevance is Calculated

In `ISearchable.cs`, the method `CalculateSearchWeight(ISearchable<T> result, string[] terms)` is the magic that guesses the importance of each model in the result set:

1. Call `DefineSearchWeights<T>()` to get the dictionary of weights to use in the scoring algorithm.
2. For every field specified in `Model.DefineSearchWeights()`, when a term is found in the field, add score:
   1. Take {term length}^2.  This adds preference for longer terms.
   2. Multiply by {term length - index of term}^2.
   3. Multiply by the dev-specified weight.
   4. Repeat for every occurrence of the term in the field (so `foo bar` would be less relevant than `bar foo foo bar`)

### No Fuzzy Search

Mongo _does_ support fuzzy search, but it comes with limitations.  A collection only supports a single text search index, and the fields the index is built on are static, requiring it to be rebuilt when you want to include a different field as part of the search.  MINQ's kind of search is just a naive check for case-insensitive substrings with a regex - however, it does allow us to create searches easily without heavy indexing.

MINQ _does_ still create indexes to efficiently handle all queries, so as with every other MINQ command you use, it's best practice to use the same fields and same order wherever possible to keep indexing low.

### Limitations

Due to its expensive nature, MINQ Search has some initial limitations.  Future versions may improve them, but they are currently:

* Terms are split by commas and whitespace.  A term with whitespace includes the initial value as a term: e.g. "foo bar" becomes `["foo bar", "foo", "bar"].`  Terms of length 0-2 are **ignored**.
* A maximum of 5 terms is allowed. 
* A maximum of 10 fields are allowed for searching.
* A maximum of 1,000 records can be returned.

Terms and fields create multiplicative queries; it's effectively building a complex "Or" clause on top of whatever your existing filter is.

Because there's no way to score all results on the database with search, any time your search returns the maximum number of results, you will not be getting the most relevant results.  Narrowing the query down will help.

### Caching

(TODO: Docs)

Depending on your use case, leveraging MINQ's caching could dramatically improve your Search performance.  However, this could also do the opposite; each cached result creates temporary copies of query responses in a separate collection.  If your search is user-facing, caching garbage input could create enormous amounts of data.

As a rule of thumb, caching makes more sense for admin users rather than something that may be UGC (user-generated content).
